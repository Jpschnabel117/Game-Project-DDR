# Game-Project-DDR

"Welcome to my first project I made during my programming bootcamp! This game is a simple clone of the popular Dance Dance Revolution rhythm game! This game utilizes HTML5 canvas and JavaScript to create an interactive and dynamic experience for the player. Play the game with the arrow keys and mouse to select a song. Your total score is calculated based on misses, great hits and PERFECT hits. The game also utilizes CSS for styling and layout, making it visually appealing. Give it a try and see if you reach S-Rank on all the songs!"
